# Various excercises and experiments

Just simple excercises and experiments for personal learning on:
- numerical analysis
- data analysis
- sci comp
- etc.

Dependencies of notebooks are documented in the README of each subfolder respectively, because different set of excercises may have different dependencies.

These are all sporadic small scripts. I might delete the whole repo at some point.
