# Various excercises and experiments

Just simple excercises and experiments for personal learning on:
- numerical analysis
- data analysis
- sci comp
- etc.

Dependencies of notebooks are documented in the README of each subfolder respectively, because different set of excercises may have different dependencies.

Currently only one subfolder but still keeping this folder strucure in case there are more in the future. If not, then I will just delete the whole repo at some point.
